## General Context

This dashboard has been developed for a university course, and its main aim it's to help the user with
making the best decisions for trading with cryptocurrencies.
It uses real time data, downloaded mainly using yfinance library.
In the file requirements.txt it's possible to see all libraries needed
to run the file. 
The dashboard has been deployed also online, and it's possible
to see it using this link: https://crypto-dashboard-group-i.onrender.com


## Business Situation

Warner Buffer and Gil Bates, partners of Investments4Some, after looking into
the work you did during your last project, decided to hire you once again.
They are asking you to develop a dashboard for their financial analysts.
However, they expect a flexible dashboard, that fetches daily updated data
about any arbitrary financial asset. They expect to use this dashboard to
inform the investment decisions of their internal financial team and external
stakeholders.

Your client expects you to create a dashboard that will be available for as
many assets as possible. They prefer to have a generalistic dashboard to
analyse and compare any type of asset. However, if the latter is not possible,
they would like to get (as a fallback) a dashboard primarily focused on the
cryptocurrencies used in the last project.
